# Absolute path to the mirror structure. This is where mirrored directories will
# be created and from where files will be moved. It can be a sub-directory of
# `--target`, and is excluded from being mirrored.
mirror: /mirror/path

# Absolute path to the real (target) structure. This is the source of truth in
# init mode and the destination in move mode.
target: /real/path

# Absolute path to exclude from operations. Can be repeated. This prevents
# specified directories from being mirrored or moved.
exclude:
  - /real/path/skip-this
  - /real/path/temp

# Attempt atomic rename operations. If this fails (e.g., across filesystems),
# fallback to copy and remove.
#
# In union filesystems, this may result in allocation or disk-relocation methods
# being circumvented and files staying on the same disk despite that possibly
# not being wanted. Disable this setting for such use cases.
#
# Default: false
direct: true

# Re-read the target file again after moving and verify against a previously
# calculated (source file) hash, ensuring target was written to disk without
# corruption. Requires a full re-read of the target file.
#
# Default: false
verify: false

# Do not move empty directories in `--mode=move`. This setting can help prevent
# accidental re-creation of directories which no longer exist in the target
# structure, if no files are contained (to be moved). Such a case can happen
# when the target structure has changed and it was forgotten to run `--mode=init`
# to reflect these changes on the mirror.
#
# Default: true
skip-empty: true

# Remove empty mirror directories in `--mode=move`; only when used together with
# `--skip-empty` and no longer existing on the target. While not a replacement
# for a full `--mode=init`, this setting can help weed out no longer existing
# directories between any two `--mode=move`s.
#
# A major downside is that it also removes newly created directories within the
# mirror, those which do not contain files to be moved yet. Hence, using only
# `--skip-empty` and doing proper `--mode=init`s is to always be preferred over
# using this for cleanup purposes in production.
#
# Default: false
remove-empty: false

# Do not exit on non-fatal failures, skip the failed element and proceed
# instead; returns with a partial failure return code.
#
# Default: false
skip-failed: false

# Adds a 1 second timeout after each 50 directories created in `--mode=init`;
# helps avoid thrashing more sensitive filesystems.
#
# Default: false
slow-mode: false

# A numeric value that decides how deep directories are mirrored in
# `--mode=init`. A value of 0 mirrors only the contents of the directory root,
# conversely negative values impose no limit.

# Default: -1
init-depth: -1

# Perform a preview of operations, without filesystem changes. Useful for
# verifying behavior before execution.
#
# Default: false
dry-run: false

# Controls verbosity of the operational logs that are emitted.

# Default: info

# Outputs in JSON format the operational logs that are emitted. Allows for
